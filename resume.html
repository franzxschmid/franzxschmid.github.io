		  <h3>Early Years</h3>
		  <p>
	             I was born 22.12.1986 in Munich-Lehel and I grew up in the beautiful Allgäu.</p>
		  </p>
		
		  <h4>2009 – 2012 Bachelor Programme in Political Science and Economics at LMU Munich</h4>
          
		  <h5>Game and Political Theory</h5>

		  <p>
		     I started studing Political Science and Economics at Munich. One of my favourite Topics was Political Theory. That's the philosophical Stuff,
    		     where the famous historical Guys like Aristoteles, Locke and Habermas are explaining why and how humans live together in States. Because I also
		     always wanted to calculate Stuff, I also enjoyed my outer Subject. Espacially Game Theory, about which I wrote my Thesis.
		  </p>

		  <h4>2013 Trainee at Personal Total Stuttgart Dr. Scharff + Eiberger</h4>

		  <p>
		     Between my Bachelor and Master Programm, I had an Internship at Stuttgart. Here I had my first Experience with Queries and Database Development.
		     I also got involved on the Front End for the first time, while formatting Job Advertisements in HTML. It was a pretty good time at  Dr. Scharff
		     and Eiberger. I had my the best working atmosphere ever.

                  <h3>Education</h3>
		
                  <h4>2013 – 2016 Master Programme in Economics at the University of Augsburg</h4>
		  <h5>Quantitive Methods and Operations Research</h5>

		  <p>
		     At the Beginning of my Master, I did a lot of Quantitive Methods: Decicion Theory, Stochastic Processes, Time Series Analysis and Econometrics.
		     During the Course Computational Macroeconomics, I discovered my Passion for Programming. We had to programm a Modell, that simulates
		     what happens to an Economy, if it got hit by a Shook. I felt transzendental, then I had to press an Button and than a little World was simulated
		     and running (<a href="https://www.grin.com/login/#document/334306">click here</a>).
		     <br>
		     So I wanted to do more with Programming, this is why I did more Operations Research (Heuristics and Algorithms.) in the second Half of my Master
		     Programm. My Thesis had the beautiful Name: „Simulation-based Algorithms for the Solution of Markov Decision Problems“. I developed an Algorithm to
		     contoll the Capacity of an Intensiv Care Unit at an hospital. Therfore I had to Model the Problem as an Markov Decision Problem and find the best
	             suiting Probabilty Distributions for incoming Patients and there length of stay throuh Kolomogorov-Sminrov and Chi-Squared Test. The Problem is
		     binary, the Hospital can remit surgerys, after that the patient needs intensic care to outer hospitals.The Algorithm itself was inspired by
		     Evolutionary Policy Iteration. It first regarded the patient, who is expecte to be released next based on his health condition, than it
		     calculates through Simulation what is the best Decision. Because the Problem is binary, the algorithm wants to know at which Length of Stay it's
		     better to make one Decision or the outer. Than it watches the Patient that will be released second next and so it can interate through. It was
		     impemented in Java (<a href="https://www.grin.com/login/#document/334308">for further Reading click here</a>).

		  <h3>Professional Experience</h3>

		  <h4>2016 – 2017 BMW Group in Munich (external via Csion Consulting GmbH)</h4>
		  		  <ul>
            <li>Consultant</li>
          </ul>
		  <ul>
            <li>Project Manager</li>
          </ul>
		  <p>
		     Here I did some Administration (Rights Administration, Onboarding) and I can tell you one thing: be polite to you Administrator. You don't want
		     to do his Job, so be glad that he is there. I also did Assistance in the Requirements Engineering, so I could learn why this is an important Topic
		     espacially in a big IT-Project. I also found out, that Trello and Sharepoint are pretty usefull Tools.
		  </p>


		  <h4>2017 – 2018 Analytic Company GmbH in Hamburg</h4>
		  <ul>
            <li>Data Analyst</li>
          </ul>
		  <ul>
            <li>Database Developer</li>
          </ul>
		  <p>
	             Here I developed an automatic Forecasting Tool for used Cars in R. It uses an API to get Price Courses for Predecessor Models of
		     the Customers Fleet from the Company's System, cleans this Courses (gets the Trend, Outlier Corrections, adds seasonal Effects etc.) and makes 
		     Predictions for the actual Cars of the Fleet. Thus I learned much about Functional Programming with the Purrr Package, Data
		     Manipulation and Cleaning with the Tidverse and about JSON-Objekts. Data visualization was also a Topic, I created some Visualisatzion Tools to enabel  
		     the Head of the SQL-Team to gain Insights about Vendors. For example with Density Distributons or Box Plot to visualize Outliers.
                     The most exciting Project was the Development of an Machine Learning Algorithm for Data Wrangling with Python. 
		     It made a Random Forest Regression with Scikit-Learn to wrangel missing Data. My other Tasks were the Development of Databases (Querys and Manipulation)
                     and the Maintenance of ETL-Processes.
